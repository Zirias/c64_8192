# 8192 -- a 2048-like game for the C64

This is work in progress. In the current state, the game is playable
including a tune and sound effects, but everything else (a menu, highscores,
saving and loading state) is still missing.

Current version: **0.3 alpha**

### Changelog

 - **0.3 alpha**

   * loader code can also save (inaccessible so far)
   * added a menu (incomplete)
   * restarting game from menu works

 - **0.2 alpha**

   * loader code
   * crunching with exomizer
   * title screen with scroller
   * title tune
   * keyboard input as alternative to joystick
